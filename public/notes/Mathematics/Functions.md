# Introduction to Algebra

In this lesson, we will explore the basics of algebra. Algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols.

## Basic Concepts

### Variables

A variable is a symbol used to represent a number in expressions or equations. For example, in the equation:

$$
x + 2 = 5
$$

### Expressions

An expression is a combination of numbers, variables, and operations. For example:

$$
3x + 2
$$

### Equations

An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal. For example:

$$
3x + 2 = 11
$$

### Solving Equations

To solve an equation, we find the value of the variable that makes the equation true. For example, to solve the equation:

$$
3x + 2 = 11
$$

We subtract 2 from both sides:

$$
3x = 9
$$

Then divide by 3:

$$
x = 3
$$

## Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation is an equation of the form:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

The solutions to a quadratic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

## Conclusion

Algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that provides a way to represent and solve problems using variables and equations. Understanding these basic concepts will help you in more advanced topics in mathematics.
